1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 I couldn't tell your mother why I was here.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 But that time's come to an end.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And now we need to get Earth ready to join the Viltrum Empire.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Mark, this is good news.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 We can finally do what we were meant to do, be who we were meant to be.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 You lied to me.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 You couldn't know the truth.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Not until you had your powers, not until I was sure.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Sure of what?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Sure you were a Viltrumite.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So if I wasn't, I'd just be one more human to conquer.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 No, this doesn't make any sense.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 You love me.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 You love Mom. I know you do.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Do you have any idea how long we live?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 The older we get, the slower we age.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Viltrumite DNA is so pure, you're nearly full-blooded.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 You'll live for thousands of years.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Do you understand what that means?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Everyone you know and love will be gone before you even look 30.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 It's not something I want for you.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 This isn't your world. It's theirs.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But we can help them. We can stop wars, eliminate hunger,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 give the medical technology centuries ahead of what they have now.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 We've already been doing it. If it wasn't for you and me, this planet would be in flames.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 All we have to do is welcome Earth into our empire.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I do love your mother, but she's more like a pet to me.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 A pet?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 This is the only way, Martha.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Don't touch me. Calm down.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I will not calm down. This is insane.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 What do you think is going to happen?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I'm going to slay my friends for a bunch of aliens I've never met.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 This is my life. These are my people.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We have a responsibility to build...

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I don't give a shit about Viltrum.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 If I live a fucking million years, this is my home and I won't let you destroy it.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 You don't know what you're saying.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And I can't let you interfere.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I know exactly what I'm saying.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So be it.
